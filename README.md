## Q-learning agent for Tic Tac Toe

The repository contains codes for training two tic-tac-toe players ($X$ and $O$) using tabular Q-learning.

## To run

You need to have Python3 with packages **numpy**, and **hd5py**, and then easily run

```shell
$ python3 main.py
```

I might add some graphical interface later!
