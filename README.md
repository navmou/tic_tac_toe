## Q-learning agent for Tic Tac Toe

The repository contains codes for training two tic-tac-toe players ($X$ and $O$) using tabular [Q-learning](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/textbook/BartoSutton.pdf).

## To run

You need to have Python3 with packages **numpy**, and **h5py**, and then easily run

```shell
$ python3 main.py
```
## 
To see the hyperparameters and play with check out the file `main.py`.

I might add some graphical interface later :-).
